    <h1>CSS Basics</h1>

    <p>When you walking by your self here's somthing nice to do; kick <br><br>
        a little stone and watch it hop ahead of you.
        The little stone is around and white, its shadow round and blue.  <br><br>
        along the sidewalk over the cracks the shadow bounces too.
